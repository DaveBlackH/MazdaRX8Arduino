# MazdaRX8Arduino
This code runs on an Arduino device, and is designed to run as a replacement for the ECU in a Mazda Mark 1 RX8.  
There are many variations that appear to need tweaking from RX8 to RX8, I have documented those that I am aware of.

Please be aware - this has taken hundreds of hours of diagnostics in the car, trawling online, communications with other people, 
several blown up Arduino's and a heap of frustration.

If you feel this has even saved you one hour of time, please think about donating towards my time.

DONATE HERE, Anything helps towards the next project (Leaf RX8 Conversion).
